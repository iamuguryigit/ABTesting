# Analysis of an AB Test

This project aims to provide a guide to understanding, optimizing and evaluating A/B tests. 

_In order to obtain meaningful results from an A/B test, we utilize a concept called the **Central Limit Theorem**. This theorem tells us that when we collect a large enough sample size, the distribution of our data tends to follow a predictable pattern, even if the underlying data itself is not normally distributed._

There will be two parts including continuous (revenue) and binary (retention) targets. We will be using revenue data from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergylog/ab-test-data
and retention data from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitdw/cokie-cats. 

# Continuous Data
